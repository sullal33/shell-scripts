Bulk Docker Image Cleanup on All Hosts
Problem Solved: Reclaims disk space across multiple servers where old Docker images pile up.

#!/bin/bash
hosts=("host1" "host2" "host3")

for host in "${hosts[@]}"; do
    echo "Cleaning Docker images on $host..."
    ssh $host "docker image prune -af"
done


Real-World Impact: Saved gigabytes of storage across Kubernetes worker nodes or dev environments.
This is applicable for self managed k8s cluster, where we have access to node. 
Images are downloaded to node, hence can be accessed and deleted

In case of managed k8s like EKS< image deletion happens by Garbage Collection and managed by aws itself.
