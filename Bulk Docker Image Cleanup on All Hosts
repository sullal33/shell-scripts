Bulk Docker Image Cleanup on All Hosts
Problem Solved: Reclaims disk space across multiple servers where old Docker images pile up.

#!/bin/bash
hosts=("host1" "host2" "host3")

for host in "${hosts[@]}"; do
    echo "Cleaning Docker images on $host..."
    ssh $host "docker image prune -af"
done


Real-World Impact: Saved gigabytes of storage across Kubernetes worker nodes or dev environments.
