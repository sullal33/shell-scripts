CPU Monitoring and Alert Script
Problem Solved: Alerts if CPU usage crosses threshold.

#!/bin/bash
cpu_usage=$(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2 + $4}')
threshold=80.0

if (( $(echo "$cpu_usage > $threshold" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "High CPU Usage: $cpu_usage%" | mail -s "Alert: CPU Usage High" admin@example.com
fi

Real-World Impact: Prevented performance degradation on busy application servers.
