Sync GitHub Repo to S3 (CI/CD Alternative)
Problem Solved: Fast frontend deployments without a full pipeline.

#!/bin/bash
# Run this after cloning or pulling latest repo
aws s3 sync ./frontend s3://my-bucket-name --delete


Real-World Impact: Reduced dependency on Jenkins or CodePipeline for basic frontend apps.
