# Automated Log Rotation & Archival Script

Problem Solved: Prevents servers from running out of disk space due to growing log files.

#!/bin/bash
log_dir="/var/log/myapp"
archive_dir="/var/log/myapp/archive"

mkdir -p $archive_dir
find $log_dir -type f -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -exec gzip {} \; -exec mv {}.gz $archive_dir \;

# Optionally delete logs older than 30 days
find $archive_dir -type f -mtime +30 -delete


Real-World Impact: Prevented outages caused by full disk usage, especially in legacy systems not using log rotation utilities.
