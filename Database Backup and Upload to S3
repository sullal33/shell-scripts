Database Backup and Upload to S3
Problem Solved: Automated and scheduled DB backups with cloud storage.

#!/bin/bash
timestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M")
backup_file="/tmp/db-backup-$timestamp.sql"

pg_dump -U myuser mydb > $backup_file
aws s3 cp $backup_file s3://my-bucket/db-backups/
rm $backup_file

Real-World Impact: Ensured daily backups without manual intervention; easy disaster recovery.
